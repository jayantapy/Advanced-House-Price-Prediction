**1. In this project, I predicted the prices of Bengaluru houses. I dropped certain features that were not needed to build our model.**

**2. Following that was the Data Cleaning process where I handled null values.Then I performed Feature Engineering on the dataset which included adding new features, andling outliers and so on.**

**3. The above step was supported by Data Visualization as well. Finally to convert categorical features into numerical, I used one hot encoding.**

**4. After splitting the data into training and test sets, I trained the model using Linear Regression getting an accuracy of about 84.5%.**

**5. Finally I used GridSearchCV to find the best model and found that Linear Regression among others was the best model.**

**6. The step by step explanation can be found in each part of the code.**
