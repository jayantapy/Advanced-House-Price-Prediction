1. The 1st use case was about predicting prices of Bengaluru houses using ML techniques.Certain EDA such as _**Data Cleaning**,**Handling Outliers**, **Feature Selection**,**Feature Engineering,One Hot Encoding** _and_ **Data Visualization**_ were done.<br>
Got an accuracy of about 85% after building the model. Used _GridSearchCV_ and found that Linear Regression among others was the best model.

2. In the 2nd use case, the same objective was performed using DL libraries such as Tensorflow and Keras. Optimizer _Adam_ was used.Got a variance score of about 79%. <br>
